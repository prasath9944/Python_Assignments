    "The purpose of Python's Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is to provide a way to structure code so that it is more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. OOP is based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes that encapsulate data and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using OOP, we can define classes that represent real-world entities or abstract concepts, and then create objects based on these classes. Each object has its own state (data) and behavior (methods), which can interact with other objects in a well-defined manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP provides several benefits over other programming paradigms, such as procedural programming. Some of these benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: OOP allows us to break down complex systems into smaller, more manageable components (classes and objects), which can be developed and tested independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Objects can be reused in different parts of the code, and classes can be extended or modified without affecting other parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: OOP allows us to encapsulate data and behavior within objects, so that they are protected from outside interference and only accessible through well-defined interfaces (methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: OOP allows us to define a hierarchy of classes, where subclasses inherit the properties and behavior of their parent classes. This promotes code reuse and makes it easier to maintain and extend large code bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: OOP allows us to define multiple methods with the same name but different implementations, based on the types of objects they operate on. This makes code more flexible and adaptable to different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, OOP is a powerful and flexible programming paradigm that is widely used in Python and other programming languages. It provides a way to write code that is modular, reusable, and easier to maintain, which is especially important for large and complex systems."

Instance-level attributes are defined inside the __init__ method, using the self.attribute_name = value syntax.\n",
