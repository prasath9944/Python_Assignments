Understanding how to define classes, create objects from them, and access their attributes and methods is crucial to understanding Python OOP code.\n",

Encapsulation is the practice of hiding implementation details within a class and exposing only a public interface to users.

Method overriding is the ability of a subclass to provide its own implementation of a method inherited from a parent class."
