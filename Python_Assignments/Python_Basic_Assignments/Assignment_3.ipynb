    "Reusability: Functions allow you to reuse code in different parts of your program or even in different programs altogether. This saves time and effort as you don't have to write the same code over and over again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: Functions can break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces. This makes your code easier to understand, maintain, and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Functions can hide complex details and provide a simpler interface to the user. This makes the code easier to use and understand, and can help prevent errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Functions can encapsulate data and behavior, meaning that the internal workings of the function are hidden from the user. This can improve security and prevent accidental modification of data.\n",

    "Testing: Functions can be tested independently, making it easier to identify and fix bugs in your code.\n",
